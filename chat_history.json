Here's a plan for the first version of the app, focusing on a clean, minimalist design with a pastel color palette:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Smart Pantry Inventory:** Implement the core functionality of adding items to the pantry, either manually or by scanning barcodes. Display item details like quantity, date added, and expiration status with color-coded indicators.\n*   **Meal Planner & Recipe Suggestions:** Provide basic meal suggestions based on pantry contents. Integrate a simple, user-editable recipe database.\n*   **Expiration Alerts:** Set up local notifications for items nearing expiration (3 days before).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E8B57` (Sea Green)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#8FBC8F` (Dark Sea Green)\n    *   Primary: `#90EE90` (Light Green)\n    *   Secondary: `#BDB76B` (Dark Khaki)\n    *   Accent: `#66CDAA` (Medium Aquamarine)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FAFAD2` (Light Goldenrod Yellow)\n*   **Typography:** Use Inter or SF Pro Rounded for a modern, clean look.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Implement the UI for the Pantry Screen:**\n    *   Create a new component for displaying pantry items.\n    *   Implement the barcode scanning functionality using the native camera API or a plugin.\n    *   Design the UI for manually adding food items.\n    *   Display item details with appropriate styling and color-coded expiration indicators.\n2.  **Implement the UI for the Meal Planner Screen:**\n    *   Create a new component for displaying meal suggestions.\n    *   Design the UI for the recipe database.\n3.  **Implement Local Notifications:**\n    *   Set up local notifications for expiration alerts.\n4.  **Implement Tab Navigation:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include the Pantry, Planner, Shopping, and Profile tabs.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-28T01:23:48.054304"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Nutrion app!
